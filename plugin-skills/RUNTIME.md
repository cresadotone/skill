## Runtime

This plugin skill shares one runtime with the core `cresa-one` skill: `../cresa-one/` relative to this skill's directory (Claude Code: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../cresa-one`). Below, `{core}` means that directory's absolute path. Do not copy helpers elsewhere.

- Run helpers with `bash`, for example `bash {core}/scripts/publish.sh --help`. On Windows use Git Bash; from PowerShell: `& "$env:ProgramFiles\Git\bin\bash.exe" {core}/scripts/publish.sh --help`.
- Credentials: `$CRESAONE_API_KEY` or `~/.cresaone/credentials`. For raw API calls, load the key once with `export CRESAONE_API_KEY="${CRESAONE_API_KEY:-$(tr -d '[:space:]' < ~/.cresaone/credentials)}"`. With no key, follow "Getting an API key" in `{core}/SKILL.md`. Never print keys or credential files.
- Rules for version checks, reporting, and anything this page does not cover live in `{core}/SKILL.md`. Current product docs: https://cresa.one/docs. If docs and live API behavior disagree, trust the live API.
